# SQL Homework: Advanced Queries

**Overview**

This project creates and queries a full relational database system for a fictional sales company, Premiere Products. It demonstrates database design, data manipulation, and analysis using SQL (MySQL syntax), covering everything from table creation to complex joins and subqueries.

---

**Process**

- Database Design: Created five core tables — REP, CUSTOMER, ORDERS, PART, and ORDER_LINE — with primary and foreign key constraints and proper relational links.
- Data Entry: Inserted representative sample data for sales reps, customers, parts, and orders.
- Queries and Operations: Data filtering (WHERE, LIKE, IN, BETWEEN), aggregations and grouping (GROUP BY, HAVING, COUNT, AVG, SUM), table joins (inner, left, right, full via UNION), subqueries for conditional filtering, schema modifications (ALTER TABLE, UPDATE, computed columns like ASSET_VALUE), correlation-style queries (shared city/state between customers and reps)

**Advanced Tasks**

Included nested subqueries, multi-table joins, and derived attributes for reporting and validation.
